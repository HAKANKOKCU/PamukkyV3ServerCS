# Pamukky V3 Server C#
https://pamukky.netlify.app/v3

Rewritten version of [PamukkyV3ServerNode](https://github.com/HAKANKOKCU/PamukkyV3ServerNode). Why? Javascript kinda sucks and the code was messy.

In this rewrite, I made almost everything classes. So it should be better

# Status
I think it's usable, but expect some bugs.
Few functions are still partial.

# Notes
* Https is a todo.
* C#'s HTTP listener needs firewall rules.
* Force quitting will not save chats.
