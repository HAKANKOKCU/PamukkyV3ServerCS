# Pamukky V3 Server C#
Rewritten version of [PamukkyV3ServerNode](https://github.com/HAKANKOKCU/PamukkyV3ServerNode). Why? Javascript kinda sucks and the code was messy.

In this rewrite, I made almost everything classes. So it should be better

# Status
I think it's usable, but expect some bugs.
Few functions are still partial.
# Notes
* Https is a todo
* C#'s HTTP listener only listens at localhost
* Force quitting will not save chats.
