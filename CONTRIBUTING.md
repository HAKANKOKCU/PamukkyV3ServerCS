## I found a bug!
You can report the bug at Issues tab. But make sure:
* It's not already reported
* You are reporting at correct client/server.
* You have explained it clearly
## I changed something
### I added a new feature
* Explain the feature clearly
* Also implement it at other clients (if you can, not forced)
* Do NOT make something that clearly creates an security issue
* If you took the idea from an issue, or if there was one, you should mention it (not forced)
### I fixed an bug (or security issue)
* Do NOT make something that clearly creates an security issue (Yeah, again.)
* Explain it clearly
